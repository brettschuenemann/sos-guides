 *  In this guide you'll be setting up a basic implementation of SOS in our demo application.
 *
 *  There are a few things to note.
 *  1. The majority of the application specific code will be common for all guides in this project.
 *     You can find that code in the 'Common' group.
 *  2. This class will be implemented separately for each guide (Target), but each guide builds on the
 *     previous one so code will be moved, and in one place.
 *  3. New code for each guide will be commented.
